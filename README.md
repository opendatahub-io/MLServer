## Why MLServer?

You've trained a model. Now what?

Getting a model from a Jupyter notebook into a production API that's reliable,
observable, and secure is harder than it should be. Most teams end up writing
custom Flask or FastAPI wrappers, re-inventing health checks, batching, metrics,
and multi-model routing from scratch every time.

**MLServer gives you all of that out of the box**, with a standardised wire
format that works across frameworks:

- **One server, many models** — serve scikit-learn, XGBoost, HuggingFace,
  ONNX, and custom models side by side in a single process. No per-model
  containers needed.
- **Production-grade by default** — health probes, Prometheus metrics,
  adaptive batching, parallel workers, and response caching are built in,
  not bolted on.
- **Standards-based** — implements the
  [V2 Inference Protocol](https://kserve.github.io/website/latest/modelserving/data_plane/v2_protocol/)
  over both REST and gRPC, so your clients work with MLServer, NVIDIA Triton,
  TorchServe, or any other V2-compliant server without code changes.
- **Kubernetes native** — the core Python runtime behind
  [KServe](https://kserve.github.io/website/) InferenceServices, with
  first-class support for readiness probes, model lifecycle, and rolling
  deployments.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install mlserver mlserver-sklearn
```

### 2. Train and save a model

```python
# train.py
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import joblib

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200).fit(X, y)
joblib.dump(model, "model.joblib")
```

### 3. Create a model settings file

```json
{
  "name": "iris",
  "implementation": "mlserver_sklearn.SKLearnModel",
  "parameters": {
    "uri": "./model.joblib",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}
```

Save this as `model-settings.json` in the same directory.

### 4. Start serving

```bash
mlserver start .
```

### 5. Make a prediction

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/v2/models/iris/infer \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "inputs": [{
      "name": "predict",
      "shape": [1, 4],
      "datatype": "FP32",
      "data": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]
    }]
  }' | python -m json.tool
```

```json
{
  "model_name": "iris",
  "model_version": "v1",
  "id": "...",
  "outputs": [{
    "name": "predict",
    "shape": [1, 1],
    "datatype": "INT64",
    "data": [0]
  }]
}
```

That's it. You now have a model behind a V2-compliant REST + gRPC API with
health checks, Prometheus metrics, and Swagger UI at
[localhost:8080/v2/docs](http://localhost:8080/v2/docs).

## Features

| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Multi-model serving** | Run multiple models in a single server with independent versioning and lifecycle | Reduce infrastructure overhead; no per-model container sprawl |
| **Parallel inference** | Bypass the Python GIL via multiprocessing worker pools | True CPU-parallel prediction for throughput-sensitive workloads |
| **Adaptive batching** | Transparently group incoming requests into batches by size or time threshold | Higher GPU/CPU utilization without client-side batching logic |
| **Response caching** | LRU cache keyed on request payload | Avoid redundant computation for repeated inputs |
| **Streaming inference** | Server-Sent Events (REST) and bidirectional streaming (gRPC) | Token-by-token generation for LLMs and iterative models |
| **Runtime security** | DEVELOPMENT / PRODUCTION dual-mode allowlist | Prevent arbitrary code execution in production images |
| **V2 Inference Protocol** | REST + gRPC wire format standard | Client portability across serving frameworks |
| **Prometheus metrics** | Request count, latency, and failure counters per model | Production observability out of the box |
| **OpenTelemetry tracing** | Distributed trace propagation via OTLP | End-to-end request tracing across microservices |
| **Codec system** | Two-level type conversion (InputCodec + RequestCodec) | Automatic NumPy, Pandas, string, datetime conversion |
| **Custom runtimes** | Subclass `MLModel` with `load()` and `predict()` | Serve any model framework in under 20 lines of Python |

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "External"
        Client["Client"]
        Prometheus["Prometheus"]
    end

    subgraph "MLServer"
        REST["REST Server :8080"]
        GRPC["gRPC Server :8081"]
        Metrics["Metrics Server :8082"]
        DP["DataPlane"]
        Registry["MultiModelRegistry"]
        Pool["InferencePool"]
    end

    Client -->|HTTP| REST
    Client -->|gRPC| GRPC
    Prometheus -->|scrape| Metrics
    REST --> DP
    GRPC --> DP
    DP --> Registry
    Registry --> Pool
```

Both REST and gRPC transports converge on a single **DataPlane** handler that
manages inference middleware, Prometheus instrumentation, and response caching.
The **MultiModelRegistry** maps model names to versioned instances, and the
**InferencePool** dispatches work to parallel workers when configured.

For detailed architecture documentation including component diagrams,
sequence flows, and design decisions, see the
[Architecture Guide](./docs/engineering/architecture.md).

## Inference Runtimes

Inference runtimes are the backend glue between MLServer and your ML framework.
You can [write custom runtimes](./docs/runtimes/custom.md) by subclassing
`MLModel`.

### Shipped Runtimes (included in production images)

These runtimes are installed in the ODH midstream container images and
covered by the default trusted runtimes allowlist:

| Framework | Package | Image | Documentation |
|-----------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Scikit-Learn | `mlserver-sklearn` | CPU | [Docs](./runtimes/sklearn) |
| XGBoost | `mlserver-xgboost` | CPU | [Docs](./runtimes/xgboost) |
| LightGBM | `mlserver-lightgbm` | CPU | [Docs](./runtimes/lightgbm) |
| ONNX Runtime | `mlserver-onnx` | CPU + CUDA | [Docs](./runtimes/onnx) |

### Community Runtimes (source available, not shipped)

These runtimes have source code and tests in this repository but are **not**
included in the production container images. They can be installed separately
via `pip` or baked into custom images with `mlserver build`:

| Framework | Package | Documentation |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| CatBoost | `mlserver-catboost` | [Docs](./runtimes/catboost) |
| MLflow | `mlserver-mlflow` | [Docs](./runtimes/mlflow) |
| HuggingFace | `mlserver-huggingface` | [Docs](./runtimes/huggingface) |
| Alibi Detect | `mlserver-alibi-detect` | [Docs](./runtimes/alibi-detect) |
| Alibi Explain | `mlserver-alibi-explain` | [Docs](./runtimes/alibi-explain) |
| Spark MLlib | `mlserver-mllib` | [Docs](./runtimes/mllib) |

### Supported Python Versions

| Python | Status |
|--------|--------|
| 3.10 | Supported |
| 3.11 | Supported |
| 3.12 | Supported |

Python 3.9 and earlier are no longer supported. Python 3.13 is not yet tested.

## How MLServer Compares

| Capability | MLServer | NVIDIA Triton | TorchServe | BentoML |
|-----------|----------|---------------|------------|---------|
| V2 Inference Protocol | REST + gRPC | REST + gRPC | REST + gRPC | REST (custom) |
| Multi-model serving | Built-in | Built-in | Limited | Built-in |
| Adaptive batching | Built-in | Built-in | Built-in | Built-in |
| Parallel inference (Python) | Multiprocessing pool | C++ backends | Java workers | Runner workers |
| Custom Python runtimes | Subclass `MLModel` | Python backend | Handler class | Service class |
| KServe integration | Native runtime | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Response caching | Built-in | External | External | External |
| Streaming inference | SSE + gRPC | gRPC | Not built-in | SSE |
| Runtime security modes | Built-in allowlist | Model control | Not built-in | Not built-in |
| Language | Python | C++ / Python | Java / Python | Python |

MLServer is purpose-built for **Python ML frameworks** with a focus on
standards compliance, security, and Kubernetes-native deployment. If your
workload is Python models served on Kubernetes via KServe, MLServer is the
natural fit.

### Runtime Security Maintainer Note

If you add a new core runtime shipped by this repository:

1. Add the runtime import path to `ALLOWED_MODEL_IMPLEMENTATIONS` in
   `mlserver/settings.py`.
2. Add or update tests validating allowlist behavior.
3. Keep runtime docs/examples aligned with the implementation import path.

For third-party custom runtimes, use the image-scoped workflow with
`mlserver build` instead of extending the global allowlist. See the
[Security Guide](./docs/engineering/security.md) for details.
