"""REST inference endpoints with KServe v2 binary tensor support.

When ``rest_binary_tensor`` is enabled, requests carrying the
``Inference-Header-Content-Length`` header are parsed as binary tensor
data (JSON header + raw bytes).  All other requests are parsed as
standard JSON — delegating to the ``rest_worker_json`` endpoint when
that setting is also enabled, so worker-side JSON processing is
preserved.  Both paths use the existing DataPlane for inference and
follow the client's per-output binary/JSON response negotiation.
